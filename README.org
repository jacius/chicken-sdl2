* Installation and Usage

You will need SDL version 2.0.0 or higher. These bindings will *not*
work with earlier versions of SDL!

To install chicken-sdl2, clone the repository or download the source
from the project page, then run =chicken-install= from within the
project's directory.

(Eventually chicken-sdl2 will be submitted to the egg repository so
you can install with =chicken-install sdl2=.)

After you have installed chicken-sdl2, you can try compiling and
running the demo applications in the "demos" directory. E.g.:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
csc demos/sdl2-raw/basics.scm
demos/sdl2-raw/basics
#+END_EXAMPLE
